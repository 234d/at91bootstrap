Compiling an at91bootstrap project

1 GNU ARM Toolchain
===========================================================================================
1.1 Linux

AT91Bootstrap 3.5.1 has been compiled and tested under Linux using the following GNU ARM Toolchain
- Coudesourcery 2007 Q1
- Coudesourcery 2008 Q1
- Coudesourcery 2009 Q3
- Coudesourcery 2010 Q1
- Coudesourcery 2011.03
- Toolchain generated by OE (2011.03)
- Toolchain generated by buildroot(2011.05)

1.2 Compile DataFlashBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use at91sam9x5ek as an example,

1.2.1 Compile booting u-boot image from DataFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9x5ekdf_uboot_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.2.2 Compile booting kernel image from DataFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9x5ekdf_linux_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/


1.2.3 Compile booting kernel & dt image from DataFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9x5ekdf_linux_dt_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.3 Compile NandFlashBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use at91sam9m10g45ek as an example,

1.3.1 Compile bootiing u-boot image from NandFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eknf_uboot_defconfig 
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.3.2 Compile booting kernel image from NandFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eknf_linux_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.3.3 Compile booting kernel & dt image from NandFlash

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eknf_linux_dt_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.4 Compile SDCardBoot
===========================================================================================

Let's use at91sam9m10g45ek as an example,

1.4.1 Compile booting u-boot image from SDCard

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eksd_uboot_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.4.2 Compile booting linux image from SDCard

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eksd_linux_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/

1.4.2 Compile booting linux & dt image from SDCard

$ cd <project directory>
$ make mrproper
$ make at91sam9m10g45eksd_linux_dt_defconfig
$ make

If the building process is successful, the final .bin image can be found under binaries/
